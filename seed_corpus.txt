The presence of the APOE4 allele is associated with increased amyloid-β plaque deposition in hippocampal subfields of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease patients, as demonstrated by post-mortem immunohistochemistry studies showing a 2-fold higher plaque burden in ε4 carriers versus non-carriers.
In transgenic mouse models expressing human APOE4, amyloid-β oligomers aggregate more rapidly and form insoluble fibrils that precipitate as senile plaques, correlating with accelerated cognitive decline measured by the Morris water-maze test.
APOE4 impairs astrocytic clearance of amyloid-β through reduced expression of LDL receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1), leading to elevated extracellular Aβ levels and plaque formation in primary human astrocyte cultures.
Clinical PET imaging studies demonstrate that cognitively normal individuals carrying one or two APOE4 alleles exhibit higher cortical amyloid-β retention (using ¹¹C-PiB tracer) compared to ε3/ε3 controls, even decades before symptom onset.
Biochemical binding assays reveal that apoE4 protein binds to amyloid-β peptides with greater affinity than apoE3, promoting peptide oligomerization and fibrillogenesis in vitro, as measured by Thioflavin-T fluorescence kinetics.
Cell culture experiments indicate that APOE4 reduces microglial phagocytosis of fibrillar amyloid-β, resulting in decreased Aβ clearance and increased inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-1β) in BV2 microglial cells.
A longitudinal cohort study of APOE4 heterozygotes versus non-carriers found an accelerated rate of cerebrospinal fluid Aβ₄₂ decline and corresponding increases in amyloid PET signal over a 5-year follow-up, suggesting ε4-dependent impairment of Aβ homeostasis.
